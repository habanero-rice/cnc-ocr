*
* Installation Prerequisites
*
	- ant
	- make
	- java (JAVA_HOME set)
	- gcc
	- libxml2
	- OCR (0.8)

*
* Building the CnC-OCR distribution 
*

The following creates a distribution in folder 'cncocr_distrib': 

	make dist

The resulting distribution has the followign layout:
	- bin/
		Contains the cncocr translator
	- includes/
		Contains include files of the cncocr runtime
	- lib/
		Contains the object file generated from cncocr runtime sources
	
*
* Setting up the environment
*
   - Ensure OCR env is set:
	export OCR_HOME=`your_ocr_checkout`/ocr-install
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${OCR_HOME}/lib
   - Set up CnC env:
	export CNCOCR_HOME=`pwd`/cncocr_distrib
	export PATH=$PATH:${CNCOCR_HOME}/bin
     You can source set_cncocr_home from the current directory to achieve this, too.

*
* Running the translator
*
	cncocr_t [options] FileName.cnc


*
* Docs
*
	Some additional documentation on the CnC model can be found in docCnCHC.pdf, a document created part of the CDSC project. 
	In spite of the fact that the document was designed for CnC-HC rather than CnC-OCR, it is never the less informative about creating a .cnc file and changing it, concepts that still apply for CnC-OCR.

*
* Creating a CnC-OCR application
*

1) For any CnC-OCR application, the first step is to create the CnC graph file (name.cnc) which will define the steps, item collections and tag collections and the relations between them.
2) The second step is invoking the translator:
cncc_t name.cnc
   This will generate a series of files: 
     - Common.* Context.* Dispatch.* => These files create the link between the user code and the CnC runtime. They are normally not modified, and are overwriten on subsequent calls of the translator. If tag functions are not present in the graph file, then the Common.* files need to be edited to call the appropriate Get functions. For using user-defined types or global constants, the user may add the proper includes in Context.h.
     - 'StepName'.hc => A step stub will be generated for every step defined in the graph. These need to be edited by the user with the afferent computation. The step files will not be overwritten on subsequent calls of the translator. The role of the stubs is to provide suggested code for Put and prescribe calls based on the information retrieved from the .cnc file. These calls are optional, meaning that, for a particular step instance, the user may choose not to Put (write) all data declared in the graph file or not to prescribe (spawn) all steps specified. The full-auto option makes Puts and prescibes compulsory thus avoiding the need for edits, but restricting the application space.
     - Main.hc => Contains the main() for the program and had generated code on how a graph should be created and places initialized. It is not overwritten on further translator calls. 
     - Makefile => Contains a reference Makefile for building the application using the generated files. It is not overwritten on further translator calls.

Note: Current default runtime is _Data_Driven. (Alternative is Rollback_and_Replay. This is currently set in DataDriven.h)
3) The third step is adding the computation steps to each step stub and editing the Main to start the execution of the CnC graph.
4) make; ./name.exec args

Note: in CnC-OCR (as opposed to CnC-HC) the code generation in Main is not yet polished. Please refer to ${CNCOCR_HOME}/src/examples for guidelines.

* Examples
*

1)simpleTest
cd simpleTest
cncocr_t simpleTest.cnc
make
./simpleTest.exec -nproc 16

2)choleskyFactorization
cd choleskyFactorization
cncocr_t Cholesky.cnc
make
./Cholesky.exec -nproc 8 2000 125  ../cnc_big_inputs/Cholesky/m_2000.in 

Use batch.sh script for additional runs and more arguments.

* Additional arguments
*

Additional CnC arguments (run cncocr_t):
Usage: cncocr_t [options] <cnc_input> ...
where [options] includes:
	-h -help --help		print this message
	-d			dump parsed tokens
	-k			dump keywords
	-p			print the AST
	-dir			directory for placing generated files
	-full-auto		fully automate Main.hc and step stubs for CDSC applications 
				(This option limits the applications that can be expressed 
				 but the generated step stubs and Main.hc need not be edited.
				 The user only write the code doing computation in his own *.c files)

Additional HC arguments (run executable --help):
HC options:
    --nproc <n> : the number of processors, env: HC_NPROC
    --hpt <hpt-spec.xml> : the HPT specification XML file, env: HC_HPT
    --hpt2dot : Output hpt to dot file for visualization, env: HC_HPT2DOT
    --deqsize <n> : the deque size (default 1024), env: HC_DEQSIZE
    --pthread-stacksize <n> : set the stack size of the worker pthreads, env: HC_PTHREAD_STACKSIZE
    --hf : set the scheduling policy to HELP_FIRST, env: 
    --wf : set the scheduling policy to WORK_FIRST, env: 
    --sched_policy <WORK_FIRST|HELP_FIRST> : set the scheduling policy, default: WORK_FIRST, env: HC_SCHED_POLICY
    --bind <bind-file> : thread binding map of worker to cpu, env: HC_BIND_THREAD
    --version : print version of the Habanero C runtime system, env: 
    --help : print this message, env:

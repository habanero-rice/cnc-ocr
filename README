With the public release of OCR v1.0.0, the X-Stack project Git repository is
now publicly accessible at the following URL:

    https://xstack.exascale-tech.com/git/public/xstack.git

However, the CnC-OCR documentation is still hosted on the Github wiki:

    https://github.com/habanero-rice/cnc-ocr/wiki

You should follow the instructions on the wiki for CnC-OCR setup and testing
using the OCR project repository. Please also continue to use the Github issue
tracker for questions, feature requests, and bug reports:

*
* Installation Prerequisites
*
    - make
    - gcc
    - curl
    - Python (2.6 or 2.7)
    - OCR (0.9) or Intel(R) CnC

*
* Setting up the environment for OCR
*

If you have a copy of the xstack repository, the CnC-OCR root directory (which
contains this README) should be in the xstack/hll directory. The expected
directory structure is as follows:

   - xstack/ : the root xstack source directory
   - xstack/ocr/ : the source root for OCR
   - xstack/hll/ : high-level-libraries for OCR
   - xstack/hll/cncocr/ : CnC-OCR root directory (name doesn't matter)

If you don't have a copy of the xstack repository, you can still mimic this
directory structure to get the expected behavior. To set the needed environment
variables, navigate to the CnC-OCR root directory and source setup_env.sh:

    source setup_env.sh

This script sets the XSTACK_SRC variable to point to the xstack repository root,
CNCOCR_INSTALL to point to the CnC-OCR root, and updates the PATH to include
the CnC-OCR bin directory (which contains the graph translator tool).

*
* Setting up the environment for Intel(R) CnC
*

Get the latest Intel(R) CnC (binary) package from https://icnc.github.io, install it and setup
your CnC environment as described in the docs there (source <cncroot>/bin/cncvars.[c]sh).

Make sure the translator script is in your PATH, e.g. by doing

    source setup_env.sh


*
* Running the translator
*
    cncocr_t [options] FileName.cnc

The first time you run the graph translator, it will download and install several Python dependencies, which will be saved in ${CNCOCR_INSTALL}/py for future use.

For Intel(R) CnC use the option --intel.

* Creating CnC-OCR applications
*

1) For any CnC-OCR application, the first step is to create the CnC graph file (name.cnc) which will define the steps, item collections and tag collections and the relations between them.
2) The second step is invoking the translator:
cncc_t graph_name.cnc
   This will generate a bunch of files. The files generated in the current directory should be edited by the application author. The files in the cncocr_support directory interfaces the user code with the underlying OCR runtime and should rarely need any editing.
3) The third step is editing the code in the current directory to implement the graph's init, finalize, and step functions. Additionally, you may need to edit the mainEdt (in Main.c) to parse command-line arguments and pass them to the CnC graph when launched.
4) make run ARGS="arg1 arg2 arg3 ..."

See the examples (in the examples directory) for further details.

Smith-Waterman example for CnC-OCR
==================================

Follow the instructions in the CnC-OCR README for building and installing the
CnC-OCR runtime and toolchain.

This example includes the following files:

    * SmithWaterman.cnc:
        Specification for this application's CnC graph structure.

    * Main.c:
        Entry point for the application. Includes the code to read the input
        files into a datablock, create a CnC graph, and launch the computation.

    * SmithWaterman.c:
        Contains the initialization and finalization functions for the CnC
        graph. The init function does the initial puts and prescribes, and
        also sets the parameters for the finalization function. The
        finalization function reads the final item from the computation
        and prints the sequence score.

    * SmithWaterman_swStep.c
        The step code for the dynamic programming computation, calculating the
        maximal-score path through a single tile of the score matrix.

    * SmithWaterman_initAboveStep.c, SmithWaterman_initLeftStep.c
        The step codes for seeding the dynamic programming calculation with
        initial values along the top and left rows of the score matrix.

    * SmithWaterman_defs.h
        A header included globally in the make process that provides the
        definitions for all non-primitive types referenced in SmithWaterman.cnc.

    * run_test.sh:
        A shell script that runs the translator, makes the application
        binary, runs the application and finally verifies the output.

You must run the CnC-OCR graph translator tool to generate the scaffolding
code, and compile the application using the provided Makefile. You can use
the provided shell script to build and run the application:

        ./run_test.sh

The script runs the Smith-Waterman application twice. The first run uses very
small input sequences, and the second run uses much larger input sequences. The
script will verify that the correct score is calculated, printing OK if found.
A successful run should yield output like the following (the times will vary):

    Testing string1.txt vs string2.txt with width=3, height=3
    Size of input sequence 1 has length 9
    Size of input sequence 2 has length 9
    Tile width:  3
    Tile height: 3
    Imported 3 x 3 tiles.
    The computation took 0.000300 seconds
    score: 10
    OK
    Testing SA.txt vs SB.txt with width=569, height=661
    Size of input sequence 1 has length 100713
    Size of input sequence 2 has length 101133
    Tile width:  569
    Tile height: 661
    Imported 177 x 153 tiles.
    The computation took 9.467730 seconds
    score: 65386
    OK

Simple test program for CnC-OCR
===============================

Follow the instructions in the CnC-OCR README for building and installing the
CnC-OCR runtime and toolchain.

This example includes five source files:

    * simpleTest.cnc:
        Specification for this application's CnC graph structure.

    * Main.c:
        Entry point for the application. Includes the code to initialize the
        CnC graph, as well as handle the result of the graph computation.

    * Step[012].c:
        Step function implementations for the test application.

Run the CnC-OCR graph translator tool to generate the scaffolding code for the
given graph specification, along with the Makefile:

        cncocr_t simpleTest.cnc

Next, compile the application using the generated makefile:

        make

Finally, run the resulting binary:

        ./simpleTest.exec

The application will print several lines of trace information, but a successful
run should end with the following line reporting the result:

        Result=6 (from tag=2)

Simple graph example for CnC-OCR
================================

Follow the instructions in the CnC-OCR README for building and installing the
CnC-OCR runtime and toolchain.

This example includes the following files:

    * SimpleGraph.cnc:
        Specification for this application's CnC graph structure. This graph
        uses singleton collections, which are specified using the "unit" tag,
        represented by a pair of empty round brackets: (). Since singleton
        collections contain only one value, they have no tag/key to distinguish
        individual instances.

    * SimpleGraph.c:
        Contains the initialization and finalization functions for the CnC
        graph. The init function does the initial puts and prescribes, and
        also sets the (null) parameters for the finalization function. The
        finalization function reads the single item in each collection (X
        and Y), and prints their values.

    * SimpleGraph_SX.c, SimpleGraph_SY.c
        The step codes for putting a single time to the X and Y collections.

You must run the CnC-OCR graph translator tool to generate the scaffolding
code, and compile the application using the generated Makefile. You can then
run the resulting binary directly (it takes no arguments):

        ./SimpleGraph.exec

A successful run should yield output like the following:

    X = 1
    Y = 2
